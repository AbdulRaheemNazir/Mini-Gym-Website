Description:

Welcome to the Mini-Gym-Website repository!
This is a website that allows new/existing users, staff, and admin to log in and work on maintaining a gym.
This project was my first experience with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. It showcases my skills and knowledge in these programming languages.
The website has different login options for users, staff, and admin.
Users can create accounts and book gym memberships. Staff members can approve or reject memberships and admin has access to all functionalities of the website.
The website is designed to handle the gym's daily operations and make it easier to manage.

While this website is functional, there is always room for improvement.
The code could be more efficient, and the front-end could be more polished.
However, I intend to revisit this project in the future and remake it in a much more efficient and effective way.

During the development of this project, I found that my strength was in the back-end compared to the front-end.
Still, I plan to improve my front-end development skills in the future.

Thank you for checking out my Mini-Gym-Website repository!
